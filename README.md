# Code FastFoundationsâ„¢

By the end of this course, we want every dedicated student to have:
- an end-to-end perspective of how to work with computational machines, not just how to use a programming language;
- familiarity with the role of source control by using it throughout the course; 
- deep experience with how to plan and write effective functions;
- good technique when embarking on writing any piece of code;
- a fundamental understanding of how OOP emerges from functional programming;
- the difference between programming and writing software;
- an aspiration towards writing great software;

## Programme
* Day 1 - Processes, flowcharts and strings
* Day 2 - Files, paths and process control
* Day 3 - Special purpose libraries
* Day 4 - Object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Day 5 - Writing software

## Tips
* Commit as you go
* Avoid copying and pasting from the notes; type to gain muscle memory
* Keep up with the class
* Keep time for all sessions - we have *a lot* to cover!
* Make every effort to get the big picture. You will forget the details but better to know *why* than *what* or *how*.
